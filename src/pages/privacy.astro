        <h2>1. Scope</h2>
        <p>
          This Privacy Policy describes how First 100 ("we", "our", or "us") handles information when you use

      <section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Our products are designed for use by families and early learners. We do not knowingly collect personal
          information from children in the app experience. If you believe a child provided personal information
          to us directly, contact us and we will review and delete the data as appropriate.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>
          We retain personal information only for as long as necessary for the purposes described in this policy,
          including support response, legal compliance, and security operations. Information no longer needed is
          deleted or de-identified according to our retention practices.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>9. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We use reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect information against unauthorized
          access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. No method of transmission or storage is completely secure,
          but we continuously work to reduce risk.
        </p>
      </section>
