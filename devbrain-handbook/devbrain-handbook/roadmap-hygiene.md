# Roadmap Hygiene (Clean, Prioritized, Maintainable)

This document defines how roadmaps and progress logs should be maintained so they remain scannable and decision-useful.

## Rules

1. **Prioritized, not exhaustive**
   - A roadmap is the ranked “next bets”, not a dumping ground for every idea.
2. **Every item has a status**
   - `planned`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`, or `cut`.
3. **Every item has a why**
   - One sentence: impact, risk reduction, or dependency.
4. **Time boxes and reviews**
   - Review at a regular cadence; prune aggressively.
5. **Keep “idea backlog” separate**
   - Good ideas should be stored outside the main roadmap if they’re not near-term.

## Required structure (recommended)

- **Now** (top priority, actively worked)
- **Next** (queued)
- **Later** (real but not near-term)
- **Backlog** (ideas, not commitments)
